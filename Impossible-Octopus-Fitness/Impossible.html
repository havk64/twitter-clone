           <h1>Inspiration and composition</h1>
           <p>"Impossible" is a midtempo contemporary Rithm and Blue ballad written by Arnthor Birgisson and Ina Wroldsen, in the musical key of A♭ major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 92 beats per minute. The melody is to be played in a moderate tone and tempo. The song's backing track consists of a simple chord progression of A♭—E♭—D♭—Fm7.[2] It was conceived after Shontelle stated that she felt that radio was currently missing a "heartbreak ballad". In an interview with J-14 magazine she said "I knew that there was no song out there for heartbroken people. I just wanted to put a song out that gave people hope - things may not work out the way you want them to, but you can move past it and everything is gonna be okay... [I want to help listeners] draw the strength to carry on past a break up where you're the one in the embarrassing position."[3] Shontelle uses a vocal range from E♭3 to D♭5 in the song.[2] Billboard's Michael Menachem described her vocal precision as similar to that of Beyoncé's in "Irreplaceable".[4] Meanwhile, the production, helmed by Birgisson, was compared to Norwegian production team, StarGate[5] who are, coincidentally, the team responsible for producing "Irreplaceable".</p>
