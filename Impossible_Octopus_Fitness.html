                   <h1>Impossible Octopus Fitness!</h1>
                   <p> The octopus (/ˈɒktəpʊs/ or /ˈɒktəpəs/; plural: octopuses, octopi, or octopodes; see below) is a cephalopod mollusc of the order Octopoda. It has two eyes and four pairs of arms and, like other cephalopods, it is bilaterally symmetric. It has a beak, with its mouth at the center point of the arms. It has no internal or external skeleton (although some species have a vestigial remnant of a shell inside their mantles), allowing it to squeeze through tight places. Octopuses are among the most intelligent and behaviorally diverse of all invertebrates. </p>

                   <h1>Fitness!</h1>
                   <p> Physical fitness is a general state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports or occupations. Physical fitness is generally achieved through correct nutrition, moderate-vigorous Physical exercise, physical activity, and sufficient rest. </p>

                   <h1>Impossible!</h1>
                   <p> The principles of impossible can be applied to any aspect of your life but, as with anything, you’re only as effective as your focus, so here at Impossible, our three focuses are:
                   Fitness – Because no matter what happens around you, your body is the one thing you have 99.9% control of 100% of the time. When you learn to train your body, you learning to train your mind. You learn lessons you can apply to your day-to-day life.
                   Business – We firmly believe that creating your own business is the fastest way to creating freedom (in relation to finances, time, and lifestyle) for yourself and those around you. It is also one of the hardest things you’ll ever do.
                   Gritness – The key to all of this is having a strong mental outlook which embraces the hard things, strives for the impossible, and learns to get comfortable with what is considered uncommon. We coined this word: gritness.
                   We have a predication towards action. Talk is cheap. Action carries weight.
                   Live a great story first  – it makes writing about it that much easier. </p>

                   CrossFit Octopus is not just a gym, but a diverse community including full-time moms, elite athletes, police officers, business executive, members of the military, etc. CrossFit workouts are comprised of constantly varied functional movements, such as pushing/pulling/squatting/lifting, executed at high intensity.
                   There are no machines at CrossFit Octopus. Instead, there are kettle bells, barbells, and a huge space outside for running, jumping, climbing, and throwing. Our workouts are scalable, which means completely new beginners and CrossFit elite athletes can complete the same workout with different modifications.
                   There are many areas of fitness where you will find great improvement once you start at CrossFit Octopus: strength, flexibility, stamina, endurance, speed, coordination, agility, and balance. CrossFit is for you if you want to get into shape, lost interest in your regular gym routine, looking to get faster or stronger in a sport you already do, or just want to look great for the summer! </p>

                   <p>Octopi are incredible escape artists, and that doesn't just mean that they are good at camouflaging themselves and escaping predators. Because they have no bones, octopi can also squeeze themselves into small spaces (and I mean insanely small). For example: A large octopus could easily fit through a space the size of a quarter! They also change color according to their mood: The red color of the octopus in the video means that this guys is super angry. And wouldn't you be, if you were stuck on this boat with a bunch of people staring at you?</p>
